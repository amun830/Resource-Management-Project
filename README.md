-   These functions and scripts are used to aid our investigation into the effect of extraction from the Onehunga Aquifer 
    on the pressure and copper concentration, and hence help us make an educated recommendation to the Auckland Regional 
    Council regarding the outcome of Watercareâ€™s consent application.

##### Description #####
-   We created our LPM of the aquifer pressure and copper concentration (fitted the optimal values of unknown parameters)
    by minimising the residual sum of squares.
    
-   From this, we then considered five different "what-if" scenarios:
    -   Stop exraction from the Onehunga Aquifer.
    -   Decrease extraction rate (to 5ML/day).
    -   Decrease extraction rate less (to 10ML/day).
    -   Continue operating at current rate (20ML/day).
    -   Double extraction rate (to 40 ML/day).

-   We then conducted uncertanty analysis by creating parameter posterior distributions, and sampling from these to
    generate sets of paramaters that fit the data well. 

-   Using each set of generated parameters, we forecasted (modelled into the future) for each senario, then plotted this. 

-   These plots allow us to visualise the changes in pressure and copper concentration under each scenario, with uncertainty
    accounted for (and hence help us make a recommendation).

##### How to Use #####
-   First pull the "Resource-Management-Project" from the git repository.
-   Navigate to /Code and Data Files/main.py. Note that all the code is in the "Code and Data Files" folder. 
-   Read the header comments and decide which sections you would like to run.
    -   Switch section 'if' statement to False if you do not wish to run.
-   Wait 20-40 seconds and inspect figure outputs.
    - All figures in report produced, except the one in Lab1Plot.py (see below)

##### Data File Summary #####
